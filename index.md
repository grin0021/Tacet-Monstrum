# Tacet-Monstrum

Tacet Monstrum is a horror game developed on Unity by a small team over the course of about six months. Taking inspiration from games such as Amnesia and SOMA, there was emphasis on physics based interaction. Additionally, we wanted to add a bit of a twist to the horror genre in terms of audio. Generally when a player is in danger, audio gets more intense. We decided to flip that and distort or remove sound as the player moves closer to the monster present. I worked mainly on the AI module. Being the only enemy in the game, it was very important that the AI for our monster was fleshed out and ran smoothly. I learned a lot about Unity during production, and am very happy with how far I was able to go.
