  Description: "November 1st, 1983\n\nRenee's really stressed out lately about how
    much the project has changed from its original state three years ago. \n\nTo
    be honest, most of the changes have been fully clasified and only top personal
    are allowed access so I can't know for sure what kind of changes have been made.\n\nBut...
    If Renee's stressed out about them... Then I've got a really bad feeling."
