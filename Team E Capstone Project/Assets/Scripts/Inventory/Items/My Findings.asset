  Description: "I have to write this down, it has to be said, it has to be noted
    down. I am *NOT* crazy.\r\n\r\nPeople are going missing in this damn laboratory,
    and not a single soul is talking about it. Maybe they\u2019re just too worried
    to acknowledge it but I can\u2019t stop my curiosity any longer. I have a very,
    very meticulous schedule and I remember things, I notice change and I take it
    very seriously. Every single day I eat at the far right table in the mess hall
    with a friend of mine.\r\n\r\nOne morning, I\u2019m eating at the table and realize
    my friend is late, so I stall, I sip my coffee and wait. But after an hour he
    never came. \u201CFine\u201D, I thought, he was probably busy this morning. How
    wrong I was. My friend never showed up at the table again, and I have not so
    much as spotted him in well over two weeks now.\r\n\r\nLeft to my own devices
    while I eat now, I have begun to notice people who also had normal schedules,
    being at the mess hall at certain times everyday suddenly never showing up again.
    And the worst part? This all began as soon as that work being done in the lower
    levels began, them and their secrets, somehow I am beginning to think they are
    involved\u2026 But I must know for sure.\r\n"
