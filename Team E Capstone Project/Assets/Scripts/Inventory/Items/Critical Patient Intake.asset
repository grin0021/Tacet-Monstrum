  Description: "Critical Patient Intake as of November 4th, 1983\r\n\r\nJane Hampton
    - 35 - Female\r\nVictor Cohen - 30 - Male\r\nHaley Baxter - 41 - Female\r\nSarah
    Gill - 29 - Female\r\n\r\nDoctor\u2019s note:\r\nAll critical patient intake
    stemmed from the volunteers from the lower levels of the laboratory. All of them
    shared a very similar, and unusual symptom, whispering to themselves, unable
    to answer any of the questions we posed concerning both their physical and mental
    state.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been asked from the higher ups not to pursue any further
    and as a result, we have administered the grade 5 amnestic sedative to incur
    severe memory loss and sent them back to the lower levels to resume testing.
    On a personal note, I\u2019ve never seen the higher ups so desperate for subjects
    that we would send back patients for further testing but\u2026 I\u2019m in no
    position to question anything.\r\n"
