  Description: 'This is probably going to be the last thing I ever write.


    Something...
    Something is outside... It''s trying to claw its way in but... I don''t understand...
    Where did it come from? Why is it killing everyone.


    I don''t even know
    why I''m wasting my last moments writing this. If you''re reading this.


    Run
    far, far away from here out the way you came.'
