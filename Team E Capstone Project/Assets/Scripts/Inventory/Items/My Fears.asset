  Description: "If you are listening to this, it is a continuation of a small paper
    I have begun to write. I fear what I am thinking is too dangerous to describe
    if somebody finds it.\r\n\r\nI realize what I wrote seems like an Insane statement
    at first, but let\u2019s pretend for a moment that all goes well in the operation,
    and you keep all of your personality traits in simply another body. Who are you
    anymore? Are you still yourself? Or are you now someone else? Now imagine if
    say\u2026 you were to be transfused instead with\u2026 an animal\u2026 or something
    even more feral than an animal and you lose your ability to communicate with
    others.\r\n\r\nAt that point, what if you were \u201Cstill yourself\u201D but
    completely unable to convince anybody of that truth? Imagine barking, howling,
    roaring to your heart's content in an attempt to explain yourself only to be
    brushed off as a savage animal?\r\n\r\nSuch horrors are the things of nightmares
    that I fear slowly crawl their way into this project and I begin to fear for
    anyone involved."
