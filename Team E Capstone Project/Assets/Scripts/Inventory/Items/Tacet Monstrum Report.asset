  Description: "Project Tacet Monstrum Report - October 10th, 1983\r\n\r\nThe military
    expects results, and our methods before now have been far too passive. As a result,
    in our latest team meeting, a unanimous agreement was made to shift Tacet Monstrum
    into phase 4b as opposed to phase 4a.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we have begun to experiment
    with the idea of creating our sound eating beast using the foundation of another
    human being, thus, the increasing number of people being sent to the emergency
    room. We started small, doing small alterations through brain surgery in an attempt
    to see if we could control the actions of our subjects and perhaps sedate their
    desire to leave once we reveal our plans to them (which we have been forced to
    do, legally. They won't live much longer anyways.)\n\r\nNo progress in that regard,
    control is an issue we still need to address, but with the technology we put
    together concerning the audio dampening, and mimicking has come together very
    well, and through early experimentation we\u2019ve learned that it can be controlled
    much more effectively using signals from a brain.\r\n\r\nThis progress is not
    without consequences in the team however, I\u2019ve seen it amongst some of the
    members. They fear what we are starting to experiment with, but I have no time
    for fear, only for results. If they pose a problem, I will have them dealt with.
    I will succeed. This will be my magnum opus.\r\n\r\nDr. Brian Trent\r\n"
