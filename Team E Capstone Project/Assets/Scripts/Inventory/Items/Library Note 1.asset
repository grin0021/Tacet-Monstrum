  Description: "Sound and its Meaning, a Comprehensive Pitch Document.\r\n\r\nSound
    has ever been a sense taken for granted for humanity, but also cherished and
    loved. A contradiction schismed only by the experience of each individual. Without
    it, an animal cannot communicate, without it we cannot hear, and as a result
    we cannot speak. Your emotional expression locked away behind silence.\r\n\r\nThus
    do I pose this, the removal of sound; weaponized.\r\n\r\nImagine a world where
    we are able to deploy a mechanism capable of silencing entire battlefields, entire
    towns and more. Military deployments could occur over entire city blocks, and
    the residents would be completely in the dark, filled with confusion in the lack
    of sound. Deployed on a battlefield, invasion forces could be entirely silenced,
    thus allowing for invasions in the darkness of night in complete silence.\r\n\r\nBelow
    is a comprehensive analysis of the work that could be involved in such a work.\r\n\r\nContinued
    is several pages detailing the science and math behind such an endeavor, and
    reading all of it right now just doesn\u2019t seem possible\r\n"
