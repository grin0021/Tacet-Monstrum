  Description: "Today is Tuesday, November 1st\u2026 1983. I\u2019m gonna try to
    get the post-office team to let me send out this tape to you back home Jessica.
    It\u2019s great news, I don\u2019t know what it is, but the science teams are
    crazy busy lately, it's good news though. Keeps me on my toes to help out with
    whatever needs to get done.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, they made a major breakthrough
    down in the lower levels and now everyone\u2019s got something to do. I\u2019ve
    got no idea what kind of breakthrough they made, but whatever it is it means
    that this project is hopefully coming to a close soon and I\u2019ll be able to
    come home so\u2026 Here's to hoping.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll see you again soon, Jess,
    and I promise we can go on that vacation when I get home.\r\n"
