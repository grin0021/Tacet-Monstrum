  Description: "What makes you, you?\r\n\r\nI pose this question, in relation to
    our current research because I slowly begin to question how \u201Chumane\u201D
    we\u2019re really keeping this.\r\n\r\nEveryday, the particles that make up a
    human being change. In fact, the particles that saw you live and breathe 10 years
    ago are completely gone. As far as we can see on a molecular level, the you today
    is completely different from the you 10 years ago. But what if that\u2019s taken
    a step further? If, for example, you argue that despite you being built on a
    molecular level isn\u2019t enough to say that you\u2019re not yourself anymore,
    then what would happen if we were to say\u2026 Take your brain, and switch it
    out with another?\r\n\r\nThere seem to be scribbles over the following words
    in the document, and it ends abruptly as a result.\r\n"
